Authentication with outlook

# basic overview
This demo does authentication with Office365. It's just like those "Sign in with Google" buttons, but it works with Grinnell Outlook accounts. It does this by using Outlook's OAuth API to do initial authentication, then it creates an internal token for further authentication.
